paragraph=The LARA-R6 Series from u-blox is a family of compact, low-power, high-performance cellular modules designed for IoT and M2M applications. These modules support LTE Cat 6 with carrier aggregation for high-speed data transfer, as well as 3G and 2G fallback for reliable connectivity in areas with limited LTE coverage.<br/>The LARA-R6 Series modules feature a small form factor and a wide operating temperature range, making them suitable for use in a variety of environments and applications. They also include u-blox's proprietary uFOTA (firmware over the air) technology, which enables remote firmware updates and reduces maintenance costs.<br/>In addition to cellular connectivity, the LARA-R6 Series modules also support GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) positioning and can be used for asset tracking and other location-based applications.<br/>Overall, the LARA-R6 Series from u-blox provides a versatile and reliable solution for a wide range of IoT and M2M applications that require cellular connectivity and location services.<br/>
